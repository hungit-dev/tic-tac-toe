# Tic-Tac-Toe

After doing this project, I have learned about DOM elements, encapsulation, private variables, module IIFE and factory functions. The project was hard at first but after spending some time reading articles and ask discord, I was finally able to write the logic, which is the hardest part in this project. Building basic UI is relatively easy for me so it just took me around 1 hour
